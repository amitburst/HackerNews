# HackerNews

A Hacker News reader iOS app written in Swift, [fork of great amitburt's client](https://github.com/amitburst/HackerNews) to include [Pocket Media Native Ads](https://github.com/Pocketbrain/nativeadslib-ios).

In [a few lines of code](https://github.com/Pocketbrain/HackerNews/commit/54c6a670d304c0d614ba14e9ff75a38a4c87a67c), the library was added to the project. The rest of the app works exactly as intended originally.


## Features

* View "top", "newest", and "show" posts from Hacker News.
* Read posts using the `SFSafariViewController` component.
* Uses the official [Firebase-based Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

## Getting Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/amitburst/HackerNews.git`
2. `cd HackerNews`
3. `pod install` (requires [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org))
4. Open `HackerNews.xcworkspace` in Xcode 8.0 or higher.

## Contributing

Please feel free to help out with this project! If you see something that could be made better or want a new feature, open up an issue or send a Pull Request! I don't really plan on putting this out on the App Store, but I think it's a great learning resource for those interested in iOS development with Swift.
